# YouTube Embed

This is a feature that is not part of the original Markdown syntax, so i had to program it in. 
That means it could potentially break other Markdown implementations, but it should be alright.

The Syntax i came up with was very simple. I using a combination of percent-sign `%` and brackets `[]`.

This will create the standard iframe within a responsive wrapper, set to 16:9 aspect ratio. Any
valid youtube link should work, except maybe playlist urls.
