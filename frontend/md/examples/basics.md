## Emphasis

To write something in *italic* you need to enclose it with on asterisks: `*` 

    This is *italic text*.

To write something in **bold** you need to enclose it with two asterisks: `**` 

    This is **bold text**.

## Headlines

There are many ways to create them. My favorite whay is to use the hash/pound-sign and repeat it. 
If i want a `h4` i just type `####` at the beginning of the line. If i want a `h2` i just type `##` and so on...

# This is a H1 
## Look, it's a H2
### H3 H3 H3, you funny.

> Headlines are great for structuring a document. This could also become important if you
> plan on adding an auto-generated TOC at some point.

## Links

You can always just paste links directly and they will be converted to a link automatically

For example: http://www.google.com

But if you want to link certain portions you need to wrap them in brackets and the link in parentheses.

    We want to [link this](http://www.google.com/).

Will get you: "We want to [link this](http://www.google.com/)."
